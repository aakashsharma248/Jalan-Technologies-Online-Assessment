Jalan Technologies Online Assessment

Please copy the code from the ZooTicketingSoftware.js file and run it in a JavaScript online compiler for validation. Alternatively, you can copy the entire file and run it accordingly.

NOTE: After running the code, you will need to enter the number of guests and the age of each guest to obtain the result, as these inputs are provided by the user only.

Please react out to me for any queries.

Thanks!
